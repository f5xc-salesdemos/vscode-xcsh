  Guide for writing xcsh configuration files in JSON or YAML, understanding

  configurations. Use when the user is writing or editing xcsh config files or
  asks about field requirements and relationships.

# xcsh Configuration Authoring

## When to Use

- User is writing or editing xcsh configuration files (JSON or YAML)
- User asks about required fields or field relationships
- User encounters validation errors in xcsh configs
- User wants to understand oneOf choices or mutual exclusivity

## Configuration Structure

Every xcsh resource configuration follows this structure:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: resource-name # Required: kebab-case identifier
  namespace: namespace-name # Required: target namespace
  labels: {} # Optional: key-value labels
  annotations: {} # Optional: key-value annotations
spec:
  # Resource-specific fields
```

## Using API Spec Extensions

### Minimum Configuration (`x-f5xc-minimum-configuration`)

Shows the absolute minimum fields needed to create a resource. Start here and
add fields as needed.

### Required Fields (`x-f5xc-required-for`)

Each field has flags for when it's required:

- `create: true` — must be present when creating the resource
- `update: true` — must be present when updating
- `minimum_config: true` — part of the minimum viable configuration

### Mutual Exclusivity (`x-f5xc-conflicts-with`)

Fields that cannot be set together. For example:

- `active_service_policies` conflicts with `no_service_policies` and
  `service_policies_from_namespace`
- Setting one means you MUST NOT set the others

### OneOf Variants (`x-f5xc-recommended-oneof-variant`)

When a field uses oneOf (choose exactly one option), this extension tells you
which variant is the recommended default.

## Common Patterns

### TLS Configuration

Most load balancers need TLS. The oneOf choice is between:

- `http` — plain HTTP (development only)
- `https_auto_cert` — automatic certificate management (recommended)
- `https` — manual certificate configuration

### Origin Server Types

Origin pools support multiple origin types:

- `public_ip` — direct IP address
- `public_name` — DNS hostname
- `private_ip` — internal IP (requires site)
- `private_name` — internal DNS (requires site)
- `k8s_service` — Kubernetes service reference

## Validation Tips

1. Check `x-f5xc-conflicts-with` before combining fields
2. Use `x-f5xc-minimum-configuration` as your starting template
3. For oneOf fields, pick exactly one variant
4. All names must be kebab-case (lowercase, hyphens, no underscores)
5. Namespace references must match existing namespaces
